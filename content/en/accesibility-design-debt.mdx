In real-world projects, accessibility rarely breaks because of a lack of technical knowledge.  
It breaks because of **accumulated design decisions** — small compromises that seem harmless at first and become difficult barriers to undo over time.

It's not always an ARIA or roles problem.  
Very often, it's **design debt**.

---

### What do we mean by design debt?

Just like technical debt, design debt appears when speed is prioritized over the long-term sustainability of a visual system.

Common symptoms include:

\- One-off components “just for this screen”  
\- Undefined or undocumented states  
\- Constant visual exceptions  
\- Decisions driven by short-term aesthetics  

Each individual decision might seem reasonable.  
The problem shows up when the system grows.

---

### When design decisions hurt accessibility

Many accessibility barriers are created **before a single line of code is written**.

Typical examples:

\- Contrast pushed to the limit “because it looks cleaner”  
\- Components without clear states (hover, focus, disabled)  
\- Implicit interactions that are never documented  
\- Over-reliance on color or animation  

The code simply enforces a decision that was already broken.

---

### Components that don't scale

A component can work well in one context and completely fail when reused elsewhere.

Warning signs:

\- The component constantly needs overrides  
\- Contrast must be adjusted on every use  
\- Focus is “fixed” case by case  
\- Accessibility depends on context  

That's not flexibility — that's accumulated debt.

---

### Design without states equals fragile experiences

One of the most common mistakes is designing only the “ideal” state.

What's usually missing?

\- Error states  
\- Real disabled states  
\- Loading states  
\- Empty states  

When these states aren't designed, they get improvised during development — and accessibility is usually the first thing to break.

---

### Accessibility as a symptom, not the cause

When an audit uncovers many issues, the problem rarely lies in the last commit.

It usually comes from:

\- Incomplete visual systems  
\- Missing shared criteria  
\- Undocumented decisions  
\- Design and development working in silos  

Accessibility exposes structural problems that were already there.

---

### Quick checklist to spot design debt

Before the issue reaches the codebase, ask yourself:

\- Are all component states clearly defined?  
\- Are contrasts defined by role, not just color?  
\- Is focus part of the visual language?  
\- Does the component still work without animations?  
\- Can it scale without manual tweaks?  

If any answer is “it depends”, there's debt.

---

### How to reduce it (without slowing teams down)

It's not about designing more — it's about designing better:

\- Clear, constrained visual systems  
\- States defined from the start  
\- Accessibility as a design criterion  
\- Living documentation, not decorative docs  

Accessibility doesn't slow teams down.  
Fixing it late does.

---

### Conclusion

Many accessibility problems aren't solved with more code, but with **better design decisions**.

When design is consistent, components scale.  
When components scale, accessibility almost takes care of itself.

Design debt stays invisible…  
until it starts costing time, money, and users.
