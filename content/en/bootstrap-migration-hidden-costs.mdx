Migrating Bootstrap is not simply a matter of updating a dependency and moving on. It means intervening in a structural layer that has shaped how the interface is built, how CSS is organized, and how behavior is initialized for years. Over time, that layer becomes invisible and turns into “the way we do things here.” That is why the real issue is never the version itself, but the degree of coupling that has grown around the framework.

## Conclusion

Migrating from Bootstrap 3 to 5 is a technical change, but more importantly it is an architectural decision. If the goal is cosmetic modernization, the result will likely be superficial improvements layered on top of the same structural fragility. If the goal is intentional redesign, reduced coupling, and clearer contracts, then the migration becomes a strategic investment in long-term maintainability.

The difference between chaos and coherence is not the version number. It is the intention behind the change.
